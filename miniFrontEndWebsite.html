Countless paintings have been produced throughout the history of Western art, but only a few<br>
 have become timeless icons. What accounts for the special quality shared by masterpieces <a href="https://www.timeout.com/newyork/art/top-art-museums-in-nyc" target="a:link color="red">NYC art museums</a> as the Metropolitan <img src="file:///Users/ankushsingh/Desktop/Screen%20Shot%202018-09-06%20at%206.37.46%20PM.png" align="right" >
   <br>Museum of Art, MoMA and the Guggehniem? It’s hard to know exactly, except, perhaps, to note<br>
    that an old adage about pornography applies to masterpieces as well: You know one when you <br>
    see it. To prove the point, look no further than our list of the best paintings of all time.</pr>

   <p>Hey, this is my homepage, so I have to say something about myself. Sometimes it <br>is hard to introduce yourself because you know yourself so well that you do not know where<br> to start with. Let me give a try to see what kind of image you have about me through my self-description.<br> I hope that my impression about myself and your impression about me are not so different.

<h1><b><u>Leonardo Da Vinci, Mona Lisa, 1503–19</h1></b></u><br><br>

<p>Painted between 1503 and 1517, Da Vinci’s alluring portrait has been dogged by two <br>questions since the day it was made: Who’s the subject and why is she smiling? A number of theories for<br> the former have been proffered over the years: That she’s the wife of the Florentine merchant Francesco <br>di Bartolomeo del Giocondo (ergo, the work’s alternative title, La Gioconda); that she's Leonardo’s <br>mother, Caterina, conjured from Leonardo's boyhood memories of her; and finally, that it's a <br>self-portrait in drag. As for that famous smile, its enigmatic quality has driven people crazy for centuries. <br>Whatever the reason, Mona Lisa’s look of preternatural calm comports with the idealized landscape behind her, which<br> dissolves into the distance through Leonardo’s use of atmospheric perspective.

 <h1><b><u>Johannes Vermeer, Girl with a Pearl Earring, 1665</u></b></h1>
 <br><br>
 <p>Johannes Vermeer’s 1665 study of a young woman is startlingly real and startlingly <br>modern, almost as if it were a photograph. This gets into the debate over whether or not Vermeer<br> employed a pre-photographic device called a camera obscura to create the image. Leaving that aside, <br>the sitter is unknown, though it’s been speculated that she might have been Vermeer's maid. He portrays her<br> looking over her shoulder, locking her eyes with the viewer as if attempting to establish an intimate connection<br> across the centuries. Technically speaking, Girl isn’t a portrait, but rather an example of the Dutch genre<br> called a tronie—a headshot meant more as still life of facial features than as an attempt to capture a likeness.</p>

 <h1><b><u>Sandro Botticelli, , 1484–1486</u></b></h1>
 <br><br>
 <p>Botticelli’s The Birth of Venus was the first full-length, non-religious nude since antiquity,<br> and was made for Lorenzo de Medici. It’s claimed that the figure of the Goddess of Love is modeled after one Simonetta <br>Cattaneo Vespucci, whose favors were allegedly shared by Lorenzo and his younger brother, <br>Giuliano. Venus is seen being blown ashore on a giant clamshell by the wind gods Zephyrus and Aura as the <br>personification of spring awaits on land with a cloak. Unsurprisingly, Venus attracted the ire of Savonarola,<br> the Dominican monk who led a fundamentalist crackdown on the secular tastes of the Florentines.<br> His campaign included the infamous “Bonfire of the Vanities” of 1497, in which “profane” objects—cosmetics, artworks,<br> books—were burned on a pyre. The Birth of Venus was itself scheduled for incineration, but somehow escaped destruction. Botticelli, though, was so freaked out by the<br> incident that he gave up painting for a while.</p>

 <h1><b><u>Vincent van Gogh, The Starry Night, 1889</u></b></h1>
<br>
<br>
<p>Vincent Van Gogh’s most popular painting, <i>The Starry Night</i> was created by Van Gogh at <br>the asylum in Saint-Rémy, where he’d committed himself in 1889. Indeed, The Starry Night seems to<br> reflect his turbulent state of mind at the time, as the night sky comes alive with swirls and orbs of<br> frenetically applied brush marks springing from the yin and yang of his personal demons and awe of nature.

<h1><u>James Abbott McNeill Whistler, Arrangement in Grey and Black No. 1, 1871</u></h1>
<br>
<br>
<p>Whistler’s Mother, or Arrangement in Grey and Black No. 1, as it’s actually<br> titled, speaks to the artist’s ambition to pursue art for art’s sake. James Abbott McNeill Whistler painted <br>the work in his London studio in 1871, and in it, the formality of portraiture becomes an essay in form.<br> Whistler’s mother Anna is pictured as one of several elements locked into an arrangement of right angles. <br>Her severe expression fits in with the rigidity of the composition, and it’s somewhat ironic to note that despite<br> Whistler’s formalist intentions, the painting became a symbol of motherhood.
